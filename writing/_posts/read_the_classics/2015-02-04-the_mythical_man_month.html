  <h2>Read the Classics</h2>
  <p>
  Inspired largely by <a href="https://twitter.com/mikedoel">Mike Doel</a>'s excellent tribute to
  <a href="https://twitter.com/jimweirich">Jim Weirich</a>
  (<a href="http://vimeo.com/116446191">video</a>) at Codemash,
    I've decided to read through some of the classics of my field.
  <!-- excerpt-end -->
  I spent an inordinate amount of time reading short blog posts, trying to keep up with the latest and greatest technology,
    that I <strong>shamefully</strong> have yet to read many of the works considered Must Reads.
  In an effort to really internalize these books and papers, I'm going to record my thoughts.
  My minimum bar for success is to read and appreciate the work, leaving my reflections to remind myself of who I was when I read this book.
  The greatest success would be that I inspire <em>you</em> to read it as well.

  <h2>The Mythical Man-Month by Frederick P. Brooks, Jr.</h2>

  Soft skills are also woefully underrepresented in my normal reading.
  I tend fill my reading time with articles about particular technology, systems, patterns, or other "hard skills".
  To begin this journey, I've picked Brooks' classic collection of essays on the software engineering process.
  By all accounts this book remains as relevant today as the day it was written.
  </p>

  <h2>Chapter 1: The Tar Pit</h2>
  <p>
  The first half of this essay explains the essential difference between software written by individuals and software written by large teams.
  Brooks asserts that <em>most</em> software written by an individual or small team can be thought of as a Program.
  These programs accomplish a fairly limited task.
  In contrast, large teams produce a Programming System Product.
  This encompasses an entire system of interconnected, extendable tools, with documentation, and tests
    that together be relied upon to solve a truly valuable problem.
  </p>

  <p>
  This resonates with me as I watching open source projects evolve.
  Small applications tend to be of fairly limited use.
  Momentum really picks up as an ecosystem of tools begins to form.
  Documentation is <em>necessary</em> to attract new users.
  Tests begin to accumulate, often prompted by real world bugs.
  Over time, the system as a whole becomes a valuable Programming System Product, but only through collective effort.
  </p>

  <p>
  The same is true of successful proprietary software projects.
  Over time, the individual Programs begin to coalesce into a stable, maintainable Programming System Product.
  <strong>An asset for the company.</strong>
  No piece of the system can remain isolated, there are always additional ways it must be extended or maintained.
  New developers are brought on to do this work, and require documentation to ramp up and become productive.
  </p>

  <p>
  The second half of this chapter discusses the double edged sword of software development.
  He very succinctly discusses the Joys and the Woes of our chosen profession.
  I found this to be an excellent summary of why I love my work, and why some <em>months</em> I want to quit and find a new career.
  This would make for a brilliant introduction to prospective developers.
  The list of Joys really highlights the purely creative side of our work.
  Brooks really nails exactly why I love going to work everyday, and you can tell that he loves it too.

  The magic of myth and legend has come true in our time.
  One types the correct incantation on a keyboard, and a display screen comes to life, showing things that never were nor could be.

  </p>

  <p>
  The list of Woes is painfully on point.
  The primary thread running through each is the lack of control over what is essentially a creative endeavour.
  In my experience this has been the largest contributor to developer unhappiness at work.
  This also paints a realistic picture for new developers, setting important expectations of the types of non-technical challenges they will encounter.
  </p>

  <p>
  It is the combination of these ideas that sets the framework for the environments in which we work.
  We <strong>must</strong> work together to build meaningful, long lasting software systems.
  This collaboration is an amazing way to bring people together to produce something no individual could do alone.
  Unfortunately this collaboration is fundamentally a Hard Problemâ„¢.
  I suspect that in the coming chapters we will begin to discover that this collaboration is harder than any technical challenge.
