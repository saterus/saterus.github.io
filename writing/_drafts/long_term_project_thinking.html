  We like to believe when we write software, it is an asset for the company.
  Our cool system we built is the backbone, a critical piece of software that makes us lots of money.

  The problem is that every asset is also a liability.
  In order for that awesome system to continue to be an asset, it must be maintained.
  That probably won't be the original author.
  (Most people leave companies fairly often, doubly so for a consultant!)
  There are a lot more running systems that need maintenance than opportunities to greenfield new projects.

  So if you are destined to leave the project, what can you do to set it up to succeed in your absence?
  "Documentation" is sort of a nebulous idea.
  Diagrams are helpful.
  10k foot views of what the requirements and responsibilities are very helpful.

  A horrible mess hidden behind a good interface is usually left undisturbed if it works.
  And then a new dev can rewrite it, conforming to the sane interface.

  Using popular tools and frameworks can help a lot.
  Disecting a large Backbone app is harder than ramping up on a large Ember app.
  Both may be equally complicated, but prior exposure is transferrable knowledge.

  Most people have multiple responsibilities, so 100% dedication to a single project is a lot to ask.
  Much simpler to get up to speed quickly when ever you need to make a change.
