  I went to a talk at CodeMash about being a more valuable developer.
  Part of it was self promotion, and such.

  I really liked the part where he said "quit any job you've been doing for more than 3 years."

  Incredible advice.
  He didn't mean leave a company you had worked at for 3 years.
  Same job.
  No new experiences.
  This is key.

  Avoid assignments that require absolute mastery of a system who's inner workings are not valuable.
  Always be looking for ways in which you can learn new things that are applicable in more situations.

  This is one of the reasons why it becomes harder to find COBOL programmers.
  Nobody wants to start learning that.
  The demand is still there.
  But the skills themselves will not be as transferrable.

  Anotehr great side beenfit of open source.
  You can continue to apply your knowledge on your next project.
